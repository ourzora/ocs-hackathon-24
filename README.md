# Zora Onchain Summer 2024 Hackathon Guide

[Zora](https://zora.co) is sponsoring in the Creator Track of the [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://onchain-summer.devfolio.co/overview)

Zora’s mission is to make creating on the internet free and valuable by building products for people to be more supported and valued for their creativity. As the Creator track sponsor, we are looking for projects that help users Create, Collect, and Curate using the Zora Protocol. Projects are judged based on innovation, usefulness, UX, and technical quality, and must be built on the Zora Protocol.

We are looking for:

- Front-end clients for creation, collection, and curation (or discovery) of Zora mints.
- Ideas that may specialize in particular formats, genres, or mediums and require specific UX.
- New ways to plug into and expand Zora’s business model and protocol rewards.

For any questions, support or discussion, please [post an issue in this repo here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-ocs-hackathon-24/issues) - the Zora team will be regularly checking these issues and responding to them.
