## Hackathon Bounties & Rules

We are looking for projects that help users create, collect, and curate on the Zora Protocol. Projects judged based on innovation, usefulness, UX, and technical quality, and must be built using the Zora Contacts or developer tools. This includes:

- Front-end clients for creation, collection, and curation (or discovery) of Zora mints.
- Ideas that may specialize in particular formats, genres, or mediums and require specific UX.
- New ways to plug into Zora’s business model and protocol rewards.

### Prizes

**Grand prize (1) winner - 6 ETH** our favorite project

3 Eth to one winner in each of theses tracks:

- **Create - 3 eth** New tools/products/mediums that serve creators; new forms of media (scripts/screenplays, fonts, recipes), incentivization models, user interfaces, collaboration mechanisms, onboarding flows, Meme templates, multichain tokens
- **Collect - 3 eth** New ways to collect; minting user interfaces, minting mechanisms, pricing models, cross-chain collecting
